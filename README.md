# Personal-Portfolio-Website
This project is the website I've built to share a portfolio of some projects and personal information. I picked up this project both to learn some new web development skills and to give any of you reading this a better sense of who I am as a person, as opposed to just being another faceless drone on the internet trying to get a paycheck. I picked up the NextJS React framework and Tailwind CSS for the first time with this project to expand my bag of skills and because they seem fun and cohesive. Additionally, I want to note that I am aware of the extensive libraries of prebuilt react components that could have made this easier to put together. I want to practice with React as I'm quite new to it, so I elected not to use any prebuilt components for that reason.
